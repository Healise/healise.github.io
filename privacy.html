            <p>
                Subject to certain grounds for refusal, you have the right to access your readily retrievable personal information that we hold and to request a correction to your personal information. Before you exercise this right, we will need evidence to confirm that you are the individual to whom the personal information relates.

If we do not make the correction, we will take reasonable steps to note on the personal information that you requested the correction.
